## **N3NY000 Setup Guide \& Common Troubleshooting Steps**

**=======================================================================================================================**



#### **Pre-Setup Instructions:**

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**



Before you launch N3NY000 for the first time, make sure you have followed all setup instructions to avoid any issues while in-game. 

Make sure you sync time in order to avoid issues

Settings> Time \& language > Date \& time > Additional settings > Sync now

If you still experience errors while injecting, likely your user permissions are fucked. 

> Make a new PC user as super admin will sort permission issues. 

Make sure you have: 

\- Updated drivers

\- All [runtimes](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one) + [DirectX runtimes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=35) \[Download \*\*AND\*\* install]. 

> \*\*You need to EXTRACT\*\* them after downloading... Restart PC after installing.

\- Make sure you follow the correct procedure to inject \[Found later in guide]

\- **\*BattlEye DISABLED.** Menu will not inject with it enabled. BattlEye support will be re-added after N3NY000 gets a recode.

\- Windows Defender disabled. \*\*ALL\*\* 3rd party antivirus software \*\*UNINSTALLED\*\*\[conflicts].

> Loader not opening: Use VPN

\- Using correct key for GTA version \[**VIP is for Legacy only, Enhanced works for both Legacy \& Enhanced]**

\- \*\*DO NOT USE FSL.\*\* It does not work. You will still be kicked. \*\*Do NOT ask for help with FSL, has nothing to do with us.\*\*Your game will likely crash.

## **How to Inject:**

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

&nbsp;After completing the above steps



Step 1: Launch GTA.

Step 2: Wait for game to load.

Step 3: BEFORE you select Story/Online --> Inject.

Step 4: Enter the game.

Step 5: You will see keybind to open on screen if you followed the above steps.
Step 6: Use the menu to enter an online session. Invite only works, public sessions will not.```



\# The menu will work if you read EVERY step and follow.

> "BattlEye is required to play GTA Online" means you did NOT follow the steps. Inject in the landing page, like the guide says.

## **Common Issue Fixes:**

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**



##### \[WARNING] 00007FFDBC9A14BA (NvTelemetryAPI64): (filename not available): FreeTelemetryString

##### =========================: Update your graphics drivers, and restart PC/Laptop.

##### D3DCOMPILER\_43.DLL Error: Install DirectX runtimes, and restart PC.

##### Crashing on Inject: Install ALL runtimes, and restart PC.

##### Loader says "Injected" but the menu doesn't open. : You did not follow the instructions, you need to disable BattlEye/Antivirus.

##### Game wont launch after enabling FSL: You have outdated version of FSL, either get the newest version, or delete FSL as it is useless.

Everything in menu is locked: You are using the free version of N3NY000. To use locked features you need to have VIP key or higher. If options are locked while using VIP key then you need to go to C:/N3NY000 and delete the auth file.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

## **Joining other players using N3NY000:**

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Y**ou can play with anyone while using the menu so long as you are both using a menu. 

2 Nenyoo players or 1 Nenyoo and 1 yim player for example, can play with any other modders, only players that have BattlEye enabled will not be able to join and you will not be able to join them.



###### **FSL is a LOCAL SAVE tool.**

All it does is convert your online save profile into a local save, it is not some magic tool that lets you play public sessions. It may have worked like that before, a long time ago, but it was never the main reason for the tool and it will not be able to do it again.

It is for converting save to a local save only.



I keep getting desynced from public sessions every five minutes

We currently do not have a BattlEye bypass, and legitimate hosts will eventually remove you due to a heartbeat failure. There is currently no way to stop this other than using an actual (private) bypass. RIPTIDE or Infamous have this, while N3NYOOO needs a recode before it can support BattlEye.



I removed FSL and all my progress disappeared!

FSL reroutes account save data to disk, so any progress made with FSL will only show up if you have FSL enabled. If you don't want this, you can also use NENY000 without FSL.



I removed FSL and the game doesn't start up anymore.

This is a known issue; delete "Documents/GTAV Enhanced/Profiles" to fix. Make sure you have latest FSL file.
